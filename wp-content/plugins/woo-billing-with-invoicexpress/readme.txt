== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can you provide free support for this plugin? =

Probably not, unless it’s a very specific issue, under our consideration.
We welcome bug reports and will do anything in our power to fix them for you, but it’s impossible to provide free support on such complex software like an invoicing plugin is.

This is also why our [Pro version](https://invoicewoo.com) has a yearly subscription instead of a one-time fee. The Pro plugin will not stop working if you decide not to renew your subscription, but you’ll stop receiving automatic updates and included technical support. That’s the only way we can ensure continued development and keep up to date with WordPress and WooCommerce changes over time.

= Is this plugin an invoicing software? =

No. This is just an integration between WooCommerce and the InvoiceXpress API. You need to subscribe to the InvoiceXpress service.

= Can I contribute with a translation? =

Sure. Go to [GlotPress](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/woo-billing-with-invoicexpress) and help us out.
